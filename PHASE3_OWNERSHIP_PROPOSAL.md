# Phase 3 Final — Ownership Mapping Proposal

**Date**: 2025-01-07  
**Status**: Pending Implementation  
**Scope**: 2 cases, ~11 mappings  
**Objective**: Complete Ownership LP at 100% (6/8 → 8/8 well-mapped)

---

## Executive Summary

### Current State
- **Total cases**: 8 (6 well-mapped, 0 insufficient, 2 unmapped)
- **Current mappings**: 29 total (distributed across 6 cases)
- **Target**: 40 mappings total
- **Gap**: 11 new mappings needed

### Proposed Mappings by Case
1. **hsbc-migration-leadership** (case1): 0Q → 6Q (6 mappings) — **UNMAPPED TOP CASE** 🔴
2. **bradesco-international-payments** (case3): 0Q → 5Q (5 mappings) — **UNMAPPED**

### Scoring Range
- **95-98**: Perfect ownership match with end-to-end responsibility
- **88-92**: Strong ownership evidence with sustained impact
- **85-87**: Good ownership showing beyond-role actions

## Case Analysis

### **Case 1: hsbc-migration-leadership** (0Q → 6Q) 🔴 **TOP CASE**

**Current State**: 0 mappings (UNMAPPED TOP CASE - last one!)  
**Proposed**: 6 mappings (Q0, Q1, Q2, Q4, Q6, Q8)

**STAR Summary**:
- **Situation**: HSBC Brasil sale to Bradesco (US$5.2B) at risk. BACEN report: 17 control failures, 94K FATCA non-compliant accounts, premium NPS 71→52. 18 months to closing. 2.7M accounts + US$3.2B assets migration without owner. Operations, Compliance, IT, Commercial all deflecting. Classic absent ownership: critical project, multiple finger-pointing areas, no end-to-end vision.
- **Task**: Even with formal remit restricted to digital transformation PMO, declared himself single-threaded owner of end-to-end transition. Set explicit goals: migrate 100% accounts (zero data loss), HNWI churn <0.5%, premium NPS >70, close all BACEN/IRS audits with no findings. Pushed back on board 18→12 month compression request. Responsibility: technical execution + regulatory governance + C-Level stakeholder management + premium client retention + post-migration sustaining.
- **Action**: Redesigned governance (data, compliance, customer, technology) and ran daily war room as single-threaded leader. (1) Built financial/regulatory risk scenarios (R$110M fines, R$180M remediation, US$58M annual loss if 20% HNWI churn), secured R$9.5M control buffer from CFO. (2) Created monitoring mechanism: 2.3TB logs from 7 systems, normalized in Python, Tableau dashboard with 28 daily indicators, reviewed with BACEN/IRS every Friday. (3) One-to-one retention: personally called 60 of top 200 HNWIs, co-created scripts, opened 24/7 secure channel (critical tickets 37→11/week). (4) Faced Compliance director resistance freezing 12K accounts over biometrics—flew to Brasília, co-presented with BACEN director, obtained no-objection letter, embedded facial-recognition (false positives 4.3%→0.8%).
- **Result**: Led 8 migration waves on 18-month schedule with zero critical incidents, 99.98% data accuracy (vs. 99.85% global benchmark). Premium NPS 52→78 in 120 days, HNWI churn 0.3% (vs. 0.5% cap), 92% clients cited proactive communication. Cleared 94K FATCA backlogs, passed 6 BACEN/IRS audits with no findings, unlocked R$46M early synergies enabling cross-sell 2 months ahead. Ownership extended beyond go-live: structured sustaining team with <4h SLA critical incidents, documented 127 operational procedures, trained 89 analysts in 3 weeks, maintained 24/7 availability for 60 days post-migration. Received global Operational Excellence award, governance mechanism became template for 3 subsequent HSBC integrations.
- **Learning**: True ownership means grabbing wheel even in spaces no one hands to you and extends far beyond go-live. High-stakes integrations demand three pillars: (1) regulatory storytelling from day one, (2) premium-client protection with one-to-one communication, (3) mechanisms that keep running after project ends. Never declare victory before proving operational stability ≥30 days. Framework replicated across 6 projects with 31% reduction in post-go-live stabilization time.

**Mapping Justifications**:

#### **Q0: "Nos conte uma situação onde você assumiu responsabilidade além do seu escopo de trabalho e área de conhecimento - como lidou com isso, equilibrando as tarefas atuais/normais com essas outras (novas)?"** → Score: **98**
- **Evidence**: PERFECT match for Q0 - explicitly assumed responsibility beyond formal scope
- **Beyond scope**: Formal remit = digital transformation PMO only. Assumed: entire US$5.2B migration + regulatory + client retention + sustaining
- **How balanced**: Ran daily war room, delegated digital PMO, personally held 60 HNWI calls, flew to Brasília for BACEN
- **Quote**: "Eu decidi assumir ownership completo da transição mesmo sem mandato formal para isso... Mesmo com mandato formal restrito ao PMO de transformação digital, eu subi na reunião do comitê executivo e me declarei owner único dessa transição end-to-end"

#### **Q1: "Me dê um exemplo de quando você foi além da sua função"** → Score: **98**
- **Evidence**: Went beyond digital transformation role to own entire migration
- **How beyond**: Took on regulatory governance, C-Level stakeholders, premium retention, 60-day post-go-live support
- **Impact**: Zero critical incidents, 99.98% accuracy, R$46M synergies, global award
- **Quote**: "Minha responsabilidade incluía não só execução técnica, mas também governança regulatória, gestão de stakeholders C-Level, retenção de clientes premium e sustaining pós-migração — verdadeiro ownership de ponta a ponta"

#### **Q2: "Conte sobre uma decisão de longo prazo que você tomou"** → Score: **95**
- **Evidence**: Multiple long-term decisions ensuring sustained success
- **Decisions**: 
  - Pushed back on 18→12 month compression (protecting controls)
  - Built 127 operational procedures for sustaining
  - Created governance template for future integrations
  - Maintained 24/7 availability 60 days post-go-live
- **Long-term impact**: Template replicated 3x, 31% faster stabilization in 6 projects
- **Quote**: "Meu ownership se estendeu além do go-live: estruturei transição para equipe de sustaining com SLA de <4h... mantive disponibilidade 24/7 por 60 dias pós-migração para garantir estabilidade"

#### **Q4: "Como você age quando algo não é sua responsabilidade?"** → Score: **92**
- **Evidence**: Migration wasn't his responsibility—he took it anyway
- **Context**: Operations, Compliance, IT, Commercial all deflecting ("não é nosso problema")
- **Action**: "Eu decidi ir além do meu escopo e assumir ownership total da crise"
- **Result**: Saved US$5.2B deal at risk
- **Quote**: "Quando eu provoquei os diretores de Operações, Compliance, TI e Comercial, cada um alegou que o problema era de outra área... Eu decidi assumir ownership completo da transição mesmo sem mandato formal para isso"

#### **Q6: "Me fale sobre quando você identificou uma ineficiência e tomou ownership para melhorar"** → Score: **90**
- **Evidence**: Identified absent-ownership problem and took action
- **Inefficiency**: Critical US$5.2B project with no single owner, finger-pointing, no end-to-end vision
- **Ownership**: Declared single-threaded owner, built mechanisms (risk model, monitoring, retention, governance)
- **Improvement**: Zero incidents, 99.98% accuracy, global award, replicable template
- **Quote**: "Eu entendi que esse era um caso clássico de ownership ausente: projeto crítico sem dono único, múltiplas áreas apontando dedos e nenhuma visão end-to-end"

#### **Q8: "Descreva um projeto que você liderou do início ao fim - como garantiu o sucesso?"** → Score: **88**
- **Evidence**: Led complete 18-month migration lifecycle through sustaining
- **How ensured success**:
  - Daily war room with 28 indicators
  - Risk scenarios securing R$9.5M buffer
  - One-to-one HNWI retention (60 calls)
  - Weekly BACEN/IRS reviews
  - 60-day post-go-live support
- **Result**: 100% goals hit + global award + replicable template
- **Quote**: "Eu conduzi oito ondas de migração dentro do cronograma original de 18 meses com zero incidentes críticos e 99,98% de precisão de dados"

### **Case 2: bradesco-international-payments** (0Q → 5Q)

**Current State**: 0 mappings (UNMAPPED)  
**Proposed**: 5 mappings (Q0, Q1, Q4, Q6, Q9)

**STAR Summary**:
- **Situation**: International payments cost crisis: R$47→R$54 per transaction (+15%, adding R$4.3M/year). SLA ballooned 2h50→4h10, premium NPS crashed 66→48, 3 of top 20 clients threatening to leave. Building task force NOT HIS JOB—formal remit = digital transformation only. Operations, Compliance, IT, Commercial: "not my problem". CFO: 90 days to recover cost/SLA or cut headcount.
- **Task**: Although formal remit = digital transformation, declared himself end-to-end owner. Committed: slash ≥12% unit cost, SLA <3h, NPS >65 within 90 days. Framed long-term trade-off: pause marketing features 6 weeks to refactor reconciliation (prevent recurrence). Asked 7 days to present plan, promised tangible results in 30 days with zero extra budget.
- **Action**: Next morning assembled 7-person task force (Ops, Compliance, IT, Commercial, Procurement) with tight charter: 30-min daily standups, metric-driven decisions, him as single-threaded owner. (1) Built 3-scenario business case (incremental cost, R$1.2M/year churn risk, up to 0.5% BACEN fines) to secure CFO backing. (2) Pulled 160K transactions, normalized in Python, proved 68% cost from manual reconciliation + outdated correspondent pricing. (3) Redesigned workflow with queue metrics, deployed RPA reconciling SWIFT MT103 vs ledger, implemented risk score escalating >R$200K tickets for manual review. (4) Negotiated volume-based contracts with 2 correspondent banks (avg 18 bps reduction, 30-day pilot with weekly audits). (5) When compliance director froze rollout, flew to Brasília, walked BACEN through controls, tightened segregation of duties, secured no-objection letter in 48h. (6) To retain clients personally called top 30, opened 24/7 channel, published Grafana dashboard with 12 metrics.
- **Result**: Within 74 days hit targets: cost R$54→R$46.4 (-14%), SLA 2h32, backlog 1,120→160 transactions (-86%), premium NPS 48→74. Avoided R$4.8M/year losses, wiped out priority-client cancellation requests. CFO institutionalized ritual as corporate template, dashboard became standard in executive committees.
- **Learning**: True ownership means taking responsibility beyond formal scope, making unpopular long-term trade-offs (pause features for refactoring), building preventive mechanisms blocking recurrence. Not enough to fight fires—must create systems (RPA, risk score, 24/7 dashboard) monitoring continuously and alerting before crisis. Whenever spot systemic inefficiency: take ownership, negotiate trade-offs with financial impact, leave permanent mechanisms running—even when "not my job." War-room ritual with single metric + single-threaded owner became template for payment crises.

**Mapping Justifications**:

#### **Q0: "Nos conte uma situação onde você assumiu responsabilidade além do seu escopo de trabalho e área de conhecimento - como lidou com isso, equilibrando as tarefas atuais/normais com essas outras (novas)?"** → Score: **95**
- **Evidence**: Perfect Q0 match - explicitly beyond scope
- **Beyond scope**: Formal remit = digital transformation. Assumed: entire international payments crisis + task force leadership
- **How balanced**: Assembled 7-person cross-functional team, 30-min daily standups, metric-driven decisions
- **Quote**: "Estruturar forca-tarefa NÃO ERA MINHA FUNÇÃO—meu mandato formal era apenas transformacao digital... Eu decidi ir alem do meu escopo e assumir ownership total da crise"

#### **Q1: "Me dê um exemplo de quando você foi além da sua função"** → Score: **92**
- **Evidence**: Went beyond digital transformation to lead operational crisis
- **How beyond**: Formed task force, negotiated with correspondent banks, flew to Brasília for BACEN, called top 30 clients personally
- **Impact**: R$4.8M/year savings, SLA recovered, NPS 48→74, became corporate template
- **Quote**: "Mesmo com mandato formal restrito a transformacao digital, eu me declarei owner ponta a ponta e assumi responsabilidade pessoal"

#### **Q4: "Como você age quando algo não é sua responsabilidade?"** → Score: **90**
- **Evidence**: International payments crisis wasn't his responsibility—took it anyway
- **Context**: "quando confrontei Operacoes, Compliance, TI e Comercial, ouvi 'isso nao e nosso problema'"
- **Action**: Declared himself owner, formed task force, delivered in 74 days
- **Result**: R$4.8M saved, corporate template, executive committee adoption
- **Quote**: "Eu decidi ir alem do meu escopo e assumir ownership total da crise"

#### **Q6: "Me fale sobre quando você identificou uma ineficiência e tomou ownership para melhorar"** → Score: **88**
- **Evidence**: Identified systemic inefficiency in international payments
- **Inefficiency**: 68% cost from manual reconciliation + outdated correspondent pricing
- **Ownership**: Formed task force, built business case, deployed RPA, renegotiated contracts, created permanent mechanisms
- **Improvement**: 14% cost reduction, 86% backlog reduction, became corporate standard
- **Quote**: "Eu aprendi que ownership verdadeiro significa assumir responsabilidade alem do escopo formal... criar sistemas (RPA, score de risco, dashboard 24/7) que monitoram continuamente"

#### **Q9: "Descreva quando você criou um mecanismo para prevenir problemas recorrentes em pagamentos"** → Score: **85**
- **Evidence**: Created multiple preventive mechanisms
- **Mechanisms created**:
  - RPA reconciling SWIFT MT103 vs ledger
  - Risk score escalating >R$200K for manual review
  - Grafana dashboard with 12 metrics (SLA by country, cost per corridor, backlog, MTTD, churn risk)
  - Monthly committee with dashboard, SLAs, named owners
- **Prevented recurrence**: "qualquer indicador fora do limite abre incidente com plano em 24h"
- **Quote**: "Eu transformei esse caso no meu playbook: sempre que vejo ineficiencia sistemica, eu tomo ownership... e deixo mecanismos permanentes rodando—mesmo quando 'nao e minha funcao'"
