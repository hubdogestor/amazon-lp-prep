## Case Analysis

### **Case 1: unimed-harvard-healthcare-innovation** (0Q → 5Q) ⚠️ UNMAPPED

**Current State**: 0 mappings (UNMAPPED)  
**Proposed**: 5 mappings (Q0, Q1, Q4, Q6, Q7)

**STAR Summary**:
- **Situation**: Unimed leader struggling with healthtech competition (Alice/Sami growing 300% annually). 42% churn from bureaucracy. 3 prior digital projects failed for lack of methodology. No modern frameworks internally.
- **Task**: Structure innovation area and launch digital products to compete. Identified need for cutting-edge academic knowledge. Invested US$3,200 + 120 hours for Harvard 'Innovating in Healthcare' course. Goal: translate 3+ concepts into measurable products.
- **Action**: Applied 3 transformative concepts: (1) Value-Based Healthcare for APS product - 12 interviews with high-cost members, 68% sought prevention. Used Harvard economic models to demonstrate 15-25% cost reduction. (2) Structured 6 monthly 'Innovation Pills' workshops - 90min format I designed, trained 45 people as internal multipliers. Personally worked with squad leaders on Value Proposition Canvas. (3) Digital Health Ecosystems concept - interviewed 28 families, 73% wanted unified management. Adapted US 'gatekeeper' model for Brazilian culture/regulation, creating progressive incentive system instead of mandatory.
- **Result**: Launched 4 digital products. APS impacted 20k members in 18 months, 15% hospitalization cost reduction (R$4M savings vs. R$26.7M baseline). Exceeded Harvard projections (10-12%). 87% workshop participants applied ≥1 framework. Digital ecosystem drove 22% EBITDA growth (vs. 8% sector average), NPS 28→34. ROI: US$3,200 → R$4M+ (37,400%). Institutionalized: Unimed now sends 2 leaders/year to Harvard with implementation plan requirement.
- **Learning**: Structured curiosity with application purpose has exponentially higher ROI than passive learning. Adaptation more valuable than adoption - localized frameworks for Brazilian context create competitive advantage. Now asks "Where has this been solved?" before reinventing.

### **Case 2: bradesco-safe-agile-framework** (0Q → 5Q) ⚠️ UNMAPPED

**Current State**: 0 mappings (UNMAPPED)  
**Proposed**: 5 mappings (Q0, Q1, Q3, Q7, Q9)

**STAR Summary**:
- **Situation**: Building Next Digital Bank with 17 squads, 230 professionals across 3 buildings. 6 weeks accumulated delays due to unmapped dependencies. Alignment meetings consumed 40% productive time (16h/week). Traditional waterfall inadequate for digital product velocity. Previous 'agile' attempts were superficial.
- **Task**: Research, learn, implement truly functional agile delivery model for scale. Couldn't simply copy - needed deep agile-at-scale principles adapted to traditional Brazilian bank culture.
- **Action**: Systematically dove into agile scaling frameworks. Completed SAFe 4.0 Scrum Master certification (2-day intensive + 16h prior study). First Bradesco SAFe-certified professional - instant credibility. Personally facilitated first PI Planning March 2017 with 3 pilot squads (35 people). Prepared meticulously: kraft paper walls, 200 post-its, physical 10-week timeline. At 3:30pm observed energy dropping - paused, interviewed participants, added energizers, finished 5pm with alignment. Boldly adapted: redesigned next PI to 1 complete day (not 2). Co-founded 'Agile Community @ InovaBra' as learning nucleus. Designed monthly workshops, personally facilitated Design Thinking sessions - teams improved feature acceptance 30%. Created innovative 'retrospective of retrospectives' forum - practices like 'one-pager' status reports organically adopted by 3 other directorates.
- **Result**: Adapted agile model absolutely decisive for Next launch in exactly 12 months (vs. 18 planned). Reduced delays from 6 weeks to zero through dependency mapping. Agile Community trained 2,000+ Bradesco professionals. PI Planning model formally adopted in 4 other strategic programs. Reduced alignment meeting time 50% (40%→20% productive time), eliminated dependency rework - teams could coordinate 3 months ahead. Adaptations documented in 'Bradesco Way of Working' playbook, became corporate standard.
- **Learning**: In major transformation, framework is just starting point for learning journey. Real skill is curiosity to understand existing culture deeply and willingness to adapt based on real feedback, not theoretical perfection. 1-day PI Planning taught: sometimes must break 'rules' to save underlying principles. Success from relentless knowledge pursuit (certification), genuine curiosity to experiment (piloting adaptations), humility to learn from mistakes (retrospective-driven improvements).

### **Case 3: olibano-blockchain-exploration** (1Q → 4Q) ⚠️ INSUFFICIENT

**Current State**: 1 mapping  
**Proposed**: 4 mappings (Q0, Q1, Q7, Q8)

**STAR Summary**:
- **Situation**: OLÍBANO partner-investor saw intense blockchain debate. Oct 2023 quarterly: 2 partners defended investing R$800k in blockchain for international remittances, citing competitor advantage. Much noise, strong opinions, little clarity on practical business applications. Clear need for deep tech understanding vs. following market hype.
- **Task**: Requested 90 days for comprehensive technical due diligence before R$800k decision (significant portion of annual investment budget). Dual objective: acquire technical knowledge to evaluate accurately + explore practical application solving real customer pain.
- **Action**: Systematic learning approach: Completed MIT Sloan 'Blockchain and Business: Applications and Implications' (8 intensive weeks, 40 total hours), investing R$2,400 + opportunity cost. Additionally read 12 detailed whitepapers (Uniswap, MakerDAO, Aave, Compound), spoke with 3 Brazilian fintech founders using blockchain in production. Technical learning on smart contracts revealed main advantage was agreement automation and reduced intermediary costs, not crypto speculation. Focused on PME remittances problem creating comprehensive internal whitepaper (18 pages) explaining how blockchain would reduce costs 70% vs. traditional. Learned Figma from zero (6 intensive YouTube hours) to transform abstract concept into tangible experience. Designed clickable 15-screen prototype showing complete journey (Brazilian businessman sending US$10k to Chinese supplier). Final decision: don't invest due to lack of Banco Central regulatory clarity on stablecoins + concerning low digital wallet adoption by Brazilian PMEs (<5% awareness).
- **Result**: Jan 2024 meeting: presented 18-page whitepaper + interactive prototype. Firm recommendation: 'Don't invest now, monitor quarterly'. Maintained position against pressure: "My analysis clearly says we'd lose R$800k without sustainable business case." Saved critical capital redirected to customer acquisition generating R$1.2M incremental revenue 2024. Knowledge permanently incorporated into strategic roadmap with 2 KRs: 'Regulatory Clarity Level 3' + 'PME Digital Wallet Adoption >15%' as strategic trigger points.
- **Learning**: Most valuable curiosity result isn't always enthusiastic 'yes' - sometimes it's informed 'no, not yet' based on deep understanding of market realities, regulatory constraints, customer readiness. Now always conducts systematic deep dive before significant investment, rigorously separating market hype from genuine business application potential.

### **Case 4: out-of-comfort-zone-transparency-portal** (2Q → 5Q) ⚠️ INSUFFICIENT

**Current State**: 2 mappings  
**Proposed**: 5 mappings (Q0, Q2, Q3, Q5, Q7)

**STAR Summary**:
- **Situation**: SEFAZ/RS citizens lacked transparent access to fiscal data. 78% of Freedom of Information requests about basic budget execution I could put online. Lack of transparency generated 340 lawsuits/year. Existing portal 5 years outdated, useless aggregated data. Would own project with sensitive data (contracts, procurement, payroll) - any leak or error would hit institutional reputation + possible administrative lawsuit. Completely out of comfort zone: never worked with government data, sectoral LGPD, or projects under State Court of Accounts/Public Prosecutor scrutiny. Previous modernization attempts failed 2019 & 2021 for technical-political complexity.
- **Task**: Deliver completely redesigned Transparency Portal in 4 months (political deadline vs. 6 technical estimate) without compromising privacy/security/compliance. Personal goals: reduce Freedom of Information requests 60%, reach 10k unique accesses/month (monitored first 3 months), zero privacy incidents, query response time <3s. Knew needed to rapidly learn completely new domains (public governance, sectoral LGPD, open data architecture).
- **Action**: Invested 80 hours over 3 weeks studying sectoral LGPD, open data architecture (Open Data Charter standards), K-anonymity anonymization techniques. Attended 4 Federal Comptroller's Office webinars on active transparency, read 8 legal opinions from other states on data exposure limits. Created legal risk matrix classifying each data field into 4 levels (unrestricted public, anonymized public, aggregated public, confidential). Structured multi-stakeholder governance with weekly meetings (legal, Court, Prosecutor, civil society). Biggest challenge: Court wanted all CPF visible vs. legal prohibited by LGPD. Spent 2 weeks negotiating compromise: published salary ranges + position + department without CPF, created restricted audit access with justification. Presented technical-legal opinion convincing both sides.
- **Result**: Delivered 3.8 months (5% early). 14,200 unique accesses/month (42% above 10k goal). Reduced Freedom of Information requests 67% (340→112/year), saving 480h/year (R$94k). Average response time 1.8s (40% better than 3s goal). Zero privacy incidents in 18 months. Court audit classified portal as 'state reference', data reused by 23 municipalities. Journalists published 47 investigative reports in 6 months (vs. 8/year before). Transparency NPS 31→58. Learning ROI transformative: sectoral LGPD knowledge applied to 4 other SEFAZ projects, generating cumulative R$380k in avoided external consultancies. Portal became base for 3 subsequent initiatives.
- **Learning**: Leaving technical and political comfort zone accelerates maturity exponentially with disciplined structured learning and governance mechanisms. Legal-political complexity requires time for building relationships and trust - can't solve with technical excellence alone. Biggest insight: citizen transparency (Customer Obsession applied to public sector) creates natural alignment between conflicting stakeholders. Now when facing unknown high-risk domain, first asks "Who are reference experts?" and invests 20% of timeline in intensive learning before executing vs. learning 'by doing' and fixing expensive mistakes.
