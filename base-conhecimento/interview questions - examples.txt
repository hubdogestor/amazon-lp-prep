Ace Your Amazon Interview: The 16 Leadership Principles and 100+ Questions You Should Know

When preparing for an Amazon interview, you’ll typically encounter a structured format: a brief 5-minute introduction from the interviewer, followed by 20 minutes of behavioral questions focused on Amazon’s 16 Leadership Principles to assess cultural fit. Only after, you’ll move into the hands-on technical portion of the interview (coding, troubleshooting, system design etc…) and sometimes, you’ll have 5 minutes to ask your questions.

Amazon hires first for the company and then for a specific role, meaning your ability to align with their 16 Leadership Principles through your behavioral answers plays a crucial role in their decision to bring you on board. To help you excel in the behavioral segment, I’ve compiled over 100 common interview questions aligned with Amazon’s leadership principles — let’s dive in!
