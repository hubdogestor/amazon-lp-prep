     Thank you in advance for interviewing with us; we definitely appreciate your time and are looking forward to meeting you.
  The information included in this guide is intended to help you prepare for your interview and enhance your candidate experience.

                                                 Work hard. Have fun. Make history.
Amazon is a place where builders can build. We hire the world's brightest minds and give them room to invent and innovate to
improve the experience for our customers. We want employees who will help share and shape our mission to be Earth's most
customer-centric company. Amazon's evolution from website, to e-commerce partner, to development platform, is driven by the
spirit of invention that is part of our DNA. We do this every day by solving complex technical and business problems with ingenuity
and simplicity. We're making history, and the good news is we've only just begun.


“Invention is in our DNA and technology is the fundamental tool we wield to evolve and improve every aspect of the experience we
provide our customers.”
         - Jeff Bezos


                                                    Amazon’s Leadership Principles
Our Leadership Principles are the foundation of our culture and guide each Amazonian. Whether you are an individual contributor or a
manager of a large team, you are an Amazon leader. We refer to our Leadership Principles every single day at Amazon and we rely on
them to help us make hiring decisions. During your interview, the team is going to be thinking about your responses in the context of
the Leadership Principles, so we’ve included a helpful guide at the end of this doc that’s a great tool to help you align your experience
with the Leadership Principles. While there’s no need to memorize the Leadership Principles, it’s a good idea be very familiar with
them and specifically how your experience relates to each of them. When coming up with the examples, it’s important to have
different examples for each of your interviewers so we get a well-rounded view of your experience and background. Amazon is a very
data-driven company, so try to come up with some examples that include metrics or data as there’s nothing better than using a great
data point to bolster a success story.

Customer Obsession
Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay
attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.

Ownership
Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire
company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job.”

Invent and Simplify
Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware,
look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here.” As we do new things, we accept that we may be
misunderstood for long periods of time.

Are Right, A Lot
Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their
beliefs.

Hire and Develop the Best
Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them
throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our
people to invent mechanisms for development like career choice.

Insist on the Highest Standards
Leaders have relentlessly high standards—many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually
raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high quality products, services and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get
sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.

Think Big
Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently
and look around corners for ways to serve customers.
Bias for Action
Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk
taking.

Frugality
Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency and invention. There are no extra points for growing
headcount, budget size or fixed expense.

Learn and Be Curious
Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore
them.

Earn Trust
Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward
or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their
teams against the best.

Dive Deep
Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No
task is beneath them.

Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit
Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting.
Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined,
they commit wholly.

Deliver Results
Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks,
they rise to the occasion and never settle.


“Random forests, naïve Bayesian estimators, RESTful services, gossip protocols, eventual consistency, data sharding, anti-entropy,
Byzantine quorum, erasure coding, vector clocks…walk into certain Amazon meetings, and you may momentarily think you've
stumbled into a computer science lecture.”
        - Jeff Bezos




                                                        General Interview Tips
   Please remember to ask clarifying questions in every interview throughout the day. We may ask some vague or ambiguous
    questions, so a sound approach is to ask a few clarifying questions before diving into solutions. This is critical for success as we
    wouldn’t want you to spend time going down one path only to realize the interviewer was asking something else entirely. If the
    information you’re looking for isn’t available after asking your clarifying questions, try to focus on how you would attempt to
    solve the problem given the limited information you have.

   Customer Obsession is at the heart of everything we do, so it’s always a good idea to start with the customer and work
    backwards. Our customers are why we come to work every day and are the reason we do what we do. To understand your
    commitment to customers we need to hear you talk about customers, advocate for them, and champion them. We are truly
    obsessed with our customers at Amazon and want to know you are too, so please remember to talk about customers in every
    interview.

   We really want to get an understanding of how your mind works, how you solve problems, what you’re passionate about, what
    you want to do, etc., so as much as possible, try to think out loud and talk things out with your interviewers. Talk us through the
    different ways you know to solve problems, vocalize assumptions you’re making, and try to give us a glimpse of how your mind
    works through problems. And whenever possible, please try to give as much detail as possible about your specific contributions
    and what you owned. We love team players, but we also have to get a solid understanding of what it is you delivered.
   We are fortunate to have some of the best minds in the world working here, and there are usually a number of ways to approach
    solving any given problem, so if you are attempting to solve a problem one way, and the interviewer asks you to solve it a
    different way or hints you in an alternate direction, please try not to be rigid and instead try to tackle it from a different angle—
    flexibility is key at Amazon.

   When answering questions, try to be as concise and detailed in your responses as possible. We realize it’s hard to gauge how
    much information is too much versus not sufficient enough, so an effective litmus test is pausing after your succinct response and
    asking if you’ve provided enough detail or if the interviewer would like you to go into more detail.

   Be prepared to discuss everything listed on your resume. For example, if you list Java or Python as technical competencies, we
    may ask technical questions about your experience with these technologies.

   Try to review the job description before your interview in case there are areas of your experience that are particularly relevant to
    the role.

   Rather than asking you hundreds of questions throughout the day, we will instead likely ask a handful of questions in each
    interview and dig into the details. We may start with high-level situation-based questions and then Dive Deep to understand the
    who, what, when, where, why, how, etc.

   We’re very interested in what you’re saying and want to make sure we can accurately process it, so some of your interviewers
    may be typing on laptops or taking notes during your interview.

   If you are provided with a list of people on your interview loop, please look them up on LinkedIn to familiarize yourself with their
    backgrounds and interests.

   We’ll try to give you a few minutes to ask questions during your interviews, so please have different questions ready for each
    interviewer. This is an opportunity for you to interview us as well and we want you to get all of your questions answered directly
    from a variety of perspectives.

   Amazon’s environment is very casual so there’s no need to dress up; business casual is more than adequate. You’ll be with us
    most of the day, so please wear something comfortable.

At the end of the day we really want to hire smart, passionate people. Please spend some time thinking about why a career with
Amazon would be mutually beneficial and be prepared to speak to it. Although “Why Amazon?” is a standard type of question, it’s not
a check-the-box type of formality for us. We genuinely want to understand how working together with you would be great, so we get
a better sense of who you are.


“Nothing gives us more pleasure at Amazon than “reinventing normal” – creating inventions that customers love and resetting their
expectations for what normal should be.”
         - Jeff Bezos
