### Exploring Amazon's unique interview process
Learn more about Amazon’s Bar Raiser Program, an important part of how we hire and develop the best talent.

How do you get a job at Amazon? Every candidate goes through a series of interviews with several interviewers. What makes Amazon's interview process unique is its Bar Raiser Program. Amazon’s evaluation process is rooted in the company’s Leadership Principles to ensure we’re hiring people who will innovate on behalf of customers, and Bar Raisers are a critical component.

All about Amazon Bar Raisers
What is a Bar Raiser?
A Bar Raiser is an interviewer at Amazon who is brought into hiring loops as an objective third party. By bringing in somebody who’s not associated with the team, the best long-term hiring decisions are made to ensure the company is always serving, surprising, and innovating for customers. The role of the Bar Raiser is to be a steward of Amazon’s 16 Leadership Principles.
Why are they called Bar Raisers?
When Amazon launched the hiring plan for tech job candidates in 1999, it was called the Barkeeper Program. But that name implied maintaining a hiring standard, when actually the program is about raising the standard with each hire. Every person hired should be better than 50 percent of those currently in similar roles—that’s raising the bar.
Who are Amazon's Bar Raisers?
In addition to their day jobs, Bar Raisers are skilled Amazon interviewers who undergo lengthy training after being nominated and accepted into the program. They are passionate about our hiring process and serve as objective advisors during the interview process. Their craft is the guidance they provide during the evaluation process with our candidates. Because Bar Raisers hold positions that are typically outside of the business for which the candidate is being interviewed, they see aspects of a candidate's strengths and learning opportunities that we might otherwise miss. They are experts in evaluating talent against our Leadership Principles, identifying candidates who have long-term potential at Amazon and who raise the bar.
How do Bar Raisers help with the hiring process at Amazon?
Bar Raisers have three responsibilities as part of the hiring process. The first is to assess candidates for the specific role and for long-term success at Amazon. The second is to make sure there is an open, accurate and fair assessment of the candidate with every member of the interview loop participating in the discussion. Finally, Bar Raisers are responsible for helping hiring managers and others prepare for interviews, ask questions related to the Leadership Principles and the competencies needed for the position, assess the candidate, and provide written feedback. Although Leadership Principles are the foundation and culture of Amazon, in any role, certain Leadership Principles will be more pertinent than others. Bar Raisers work with the hiring and recruiting team to understand the most relevant principles to which the candidate must naturally index or those that can be learned and developed over time.
What should people know about how Amazon hires?
Amazon is focused on hiring well, rather than hiring quickly. Teams identify candidates who can best deliver on behalf of customers, personify our Leadership Principles, and are the best long-term fit at Amazon. Recruiters, hiring managers and Bar Raisers alike are passionate about finding the right person for the job and what that means for the future impact of the business they support. That hiring legacy is something that all Amazonians take seriously. It has a broad and long-lasting impact on the livelihood, creativity and viability of the products and services we create for our customers.


### 11 Amazon interview tips from recruiters and hiring managers
Prepare for Amazon’s interview questions, learn more about the process, and find out how we hire and develop the best.

How do you get a job at Amazon? Every candidate goes through a series of interviews with several interviewers. What makes Amazon's interview process unique is its Bar Raiser Program. Amazon’s evaluation process is rooted in the company’s Leadership Principles to ensure we’re hiring people who will innovate on behalf of customers, and Bar Raisers are a critical component.

Our candidate-first approach to interviewing means we'll do our best to ask fair questions and provide tools and resources to help you. However, it's still important to do your research and prep work.
If you're ready to get started, here are 11 tips to prepare for your upcoming interview with Amazon.
1.
Prepare for behavioral-based interview questions
Amazon interview questions are behavioral-based. We'll ask about past situations or challenges you've faced and how you handled them. Amazon's Leadership Principles will help us guide the discussion. Cody Nelson, senior manager of recruiting, Worldwide Operations, recommends using the job description to prepare the stories you use to answer these questions. Nelson said, "If you can think of stories and examples related to the requirements in the job description, you will be better prepared to answer the behavioral questions in your interview."
2.
Format responses using the STAR method
The STAR method is a structured way to respond to behavioral-based interview questions. Following the format, you answer questions by discussing the specific situation, task, action, and result of the experience you're describing. Stacy Milgate, program manager at AWS, suggests laying your stories out in the STAR format ahead of your interview. "Think about all of the details," she said. "Who was involved? What did you do specifically? What were the results based off of what you did? How did you make an impact?"
Once you have your stories ready, practice them in the mirror or with a partner to really nail the answer format in your interview.

3.
Provide details
"A big miss for many candidates is that they don't dive deep enough," said Rasheeda Liberty, Inclusion, Diversity, & Equity leader at Amazon. When answering questions in your interview, remember that specifics are key. Give a detailed account of one situation for each question you answer, and use data or metrics to support your example. "We want to know the numbers," said Liberty. "We want to know who was working on the project and how you delivered tangible results."
4.
Focus on "I" not "we"
Use "I," when describing actions in your interview answers. "Interviewing is not the time to minimize what you have done," said Michelle Jackson, a senior recruiting business manager at Amazon. "Of course, we understand that you've worked with a team in a collaborative environment, but interviewing is an opportunity for you to sell yourself." Be ready to describe the specific steps you took and how you contributed. Let us know what you actually did.
5.
Don't shy away from failures
It's okay to talk about failure. Come prepared with examples that showcase your expertise while describing how you've taken risks, succeeded, failed, and grown in the process. Keep in mind, some of Amazon's most successful programs have roots in failed projects.
"You can't innovate without failure," said Nelson. "Failure isn't a bad thing as long as you improve from the lessons you learned. Understand how you've taken risks in a positive way and be able to communicate that to your interviewer."
6.
Know why you want to work at Amazon
Asking "why Amazon?" is not just a formality for us. We want to understand why you're exploring an opportunity with the company so we get a better sense of who you are.
"Many candidates say they're excited about the opportunity to work for a large-scale, innovative company," said Liberty. "What I really want to know is why Amazon fits into your specific career path. We want to know that you're a person who's thinking about how to give back to the organization with what you bring, but we're also looking at what you want to learn while working here."
7.
Ask for clarification when you need it
Don't be shy about asking for clarification. If an interviewer asks you a question and does not give enough information for you to provide a solid answer, ask for more context.
"We ask a lot of questions at Amazon," said Jackson. "We want our candidates to feel comfortable with this because that's the environment and culture we actually have."
8.
Brush up on your writing skills
Your recruiter may ask you to provide a writing sample. This will depend on the role you're interviewing for, but it isn't necessarily limited to traditional writing roles. Why? One of the unique aspects of Amazon's culture is that we don't do PowerPoint or any other slide-oriented presentations in meetings. We write narratively structured memos and silently read them at the beginning of each meeting. These papers include pertinent information like project goals, tactics, outcomes, and next steps. Because these papers impact our decision making, articulating your thoughts in written format is a necessary skill.
9.
Prepare for a phone screen and multiple interviews
You will meet with between two to seven Amazon employees during your interview process. They will likely be a mix of managers, team members, stakeholders from related teams, and a "Bar Raiser" (usually an objective third party from another team).
The recruiters and hiring managers we talked to recommend bringing notes to help you keep track of the stories you share during each interview. A pen will also be helpful to jot down things like the questions you want to ask at the end or key points you want to hit in the next interview.
10.
Study the Leadership Principles
Interviewers use Amazon's Leadership Principles to evaluate candidates. Consider how you've applied these principles in your previous professional experience as you practice your stories and responses.
"We're not going to test you to see if you've memorized the Leadership Principles, but we do want candidates to be excited about them," said Milgate. "Questions about the Leadership Principles are meant to help us understand why you want to work here and how our values resonate with you."
Take some time ahead of your interview to tie your stories back to our Leadership Principles, and maybe even identify a few principles that resonate with you most.
11.
Research Amazon's culture
Amazon has a peculiar culture centered on customer obsession. As you prepare for your interview, research the company to determine whether Amazon is the right fit for you. Learn more about our culture.




### An Amazon recruiting manager offers his 3 best tips for a successful job interview
Prepare for Amazon’s STAR interview format, learn best practices, and practice with real-life examples that will help you ace your interview.

You’ve done the necessary research. You’ve applied for the dream job. You've successfully completed the online assessment and phone screen, and just discovered you are moving on to the final round of your Amazon interview. It is now time to prepare. Fortunately, you are not alone in this journey. It’s pretty well-documented and publicized—thanks to bar raisers, former and current employees, and career coaches alike—that Amazon engages in behavioral-based interviewing through the STAR (situation, task, action, and result) method.

Our interviews are rooted in behavioral-based questions which ask about past situations or challenges you’ve faced and how you’ve handled them, using Amazon's Leadership Principles to guide the discussion. We avoid brain teasers as part of the interview process as it’s irrelevant and not indicative of your actual performance. We’re more concerned with the way you critically process and behave in certain situations, embody core competencies, and the experiences that have shaped you as a professional.
We aspire to make interviewing at Amazon as frustration-free as our shopping experience. Because of this, we’ve asked Cody Nelson, a senior manager of Talent Acquisition at Amazon who has conducted hundreds of interviews in almost a decade, for his best advice on how to ace your upcoming interview. Here are his tips.
1.
Always answer the interview questions using the STAR method.
The STAR method is a structured manner of responding to a behavioral-based interview question. For our interviews we recommend candidates format their responses using the STAR method to answer behavioral-based interview questions, incorporating examples representative of Amazon’s Leadership Principles. Consider your successes and failures in relation to the Leadership Principles. Your examples should showcase your expertise and how you’ve taken risks, succeeded, failed, and grown.
We value straightforward and clear communication. We use the STAR method as a framework for clear answers. It’s not something to memorize but rather a tool to communicate your strengths and experiences.
2.
Data points give the interviewer a better picture of the context, risks, and visibility of the example.
Amazon is a data-driven company. When you answer interview questions, ensure your answer is well-structured, and provide examples using metrics or data if applicable. Reference recent situations whenever possible.
For example, your interviewer might ask: “Provide an example of a time you exceeded customer expectations.”
Below is how you might respond to this question using the STAR method and applying applicable data.

Situation:In 2020, I was a customer success manager at my previous company. In this role, I was in charge of successfully delivering software implementation to a $2 billion company, with 5,000 employees that operated in 36 countries.
Task: The challenge and task ahead of that year was to successfully implement, onboard, and train roughly 500 users, in all 36 countries of this company to use our product. Success would be measured in a monthly satisfaction survey, as well as a joint report to their executive leadership board once a quarter.
Action:This was not my first implementation, but the first of this scale. Knowing that, I formulated a plan to take these three actions. First, I created a customer feedback mechanism on a weekly basis. This was above and beyond because this was collected quarterly in the past. I also had the survey translated to 10 different languages, covering all 36 countries. Second, I wanted to make sure our users knew the “why” behind this change. I took the action of creating monthly office hours and twelve continued education sessions on the product. In fact, these sessions are now used as a standard practice for all future implementations, which there have been three of at this size. And third, a byproduct of the customer feedback actually revealed insights to other opportunities in their organization. I delivered these insights to the executive board in a thorough report, and they were delighted to hear the strengths and opportunities of their organization.
Result: As a result, the implementation was successfully delivered with a customer feedback score of 9.5 out of 10. The highest our company had ever seen. This new insight report opened another avenue of business with this customer that helped lead to doubling our business revenue.

3.
Use “I” versus “we” statements when answering the interviewer’s questions.
We want to hear what you specifically accomplished and how you were able to deliver results on behalf of your customers. Be ready to describe the specific steps you took and how you contributed. Let us know what you actually did.

# 8 interview tips from Amazon Bar Raisers to help you clinch the job
Is an earthquake interrupting your interview? (Yes, really.) These seasoned interviewers have seen it all—and offer key advice on how to succeed and shine.
Some might call it unique. Others might call it peculiar. Indeed, Amazon’s thorough interview process is designed to help hiring managers identify candidates with the biggest potential to thrive and succeed at the company. And one particular member of every hiring team is especially integral to helping managers zero in on those top applicants: the Bar Raiser.

A Bar Raiser—an interviewer who typically sits on another team—serves as an objective third party during the hiring process. As a steward of the company’s Leadership Principles, they capture a holistic picture of each candidate and aid in eliminating bias.
In concert with the hiring manager, the Bar Raiser helps drive the pivotal decision on whether a candidate should be hired. They also help ensure that every new hire has the potential to grow in their role and brings skills that are better than 50% of their would-be peers in similar roles.
In other words, Bar Raisers know full well what it takes to not only navigate Amazon’s interview process, but how to shine. Here, four Bar Raisers share essential tips on how to do just that.
Go beyond your resume.
It’s easy to become hyperfocused on the qualifications you put down on paper. But sometimes, what’s not on the page can be just as illuminating as what’s on it. Dawn Brun, director, Amazon Health Services Communications, appreciates it when a candidate “tells me something about themselves that I wouldn't learn from their resume. You can learn a lot about someone and the way they approach their work by who they are as a person outside of their professional experience.”

Familiarize yourself with Amazon’s Leadership Principles.
Every employee at Amazon is guided by 16 Leadership Principles: key tenets that serve as the backbone to how the company does business and approaches every decision—including job hires. “Prior to your interview, it will be valuable to look up the Leadership Principles and identify one or two work anecdotes that are relevant to each one,” noted Josh Hirschland, principal product manager, Amazon Community Impact. “Make sure you’re answering the question that is asked—but orienting your stories around the Leadership Principles can be helpful. As a candidate, you should have an idea in advance for what stories you want to tell.”


Understand the power of practice.
“Practice responding to questions on your own to familiarize yourself with the experience,” said Cedric Ross, senior manager, Amazon Tours. In the past, Ross has staged his own mock interviews in front of a mirror, as well as recorded himself on his phone “to help me understand how I am represented in an actual interview session.” An outside perspective also helps. “Find someone you trust to offer candid feedback and practice the interview with,” he added. “A different opinion may be helpful.”
Be self-critical and demonstrate how you learned from mistakes.
Everyone’s made their share of mistakes throughout their career. Instead of shying away from them, highlight how they’ve helped you grow. “We value when our team members are able to admit when things didn’t quite go to plan, critically evaluate both successes and failures, and learn from mistakes,” said Jess Turner, director of campaigns, International Consumer Communications. “Demonstrating what you’ve learned from a failure and how it changed the way you work can be an opportunity to really impress. My advice is to always be honest about your own mistakes, never be too quick to blame others, and demonstrate clear tangible actions you’ve taken based on the learnings.”
Show your value.
“Before responding to a question, keep in mind that this is your opportunity to demonstrate your value,” explained Ross. “Your examples should showcase your talent. No matter the role or responsibility, ask yourself if your example added value in some meaningful way.” Equally important, he said, is that you show how you added that value. “Don’t forget to end your response with a result,” he stressed—a reflection of Amazon’s data-driven focus.
Read more about the STAR interview method and how you can best use data points to highlight your successes.
Don’t be afraid to ask questions.
“We want every candidate who gets an Amazon job offer to accept that role and succeed in it,” said Hirschland, who encourages applicants to be curious and ask questions. “At its best, an interview will feel more like a conversation with a curious friend than an interrogation. That means that your interviewers will want to help you understand Amazon and the team that you’re interviewing for so that you can make an informed decision. So ask the questions that you actually want to know the answers to.”
Let your personality shine through, but always remain professional.
It’s key to be yourself during an interview, which “helps build a rapport with your interviewer and ensures you feel more comfortable,” said Turner. However, she advised, be mindful not to become overly familiar. “It might sound obvious, but refrain from swearing or oversharing negative details around past work experiences, managers, or colleagues,” she noted. “If an interviewee gets too comfortable, too quickly, or overshares personal or negative details, it can cause the interviewer to lose trust in the candidate.”
Be communicative about your needs during the interview.
If you have a virtual interview, keep your surroundings in mind—and don’t be afraid to say something if you need to take a moment to adjust. “Folks are at home, and that means that life is happening around them,” noted Brun. Maybe the Wi-Fi cut out. Or things got really loud around you. When conditions suddenly take a nosedive, don’t hesitate to speak up. Brun recalled one candidate who, mid-interview, suddenly found himself in the middle of an earthquake. “He said, ‘We can keep going,’ and I said, ‘You go and get yourself to a safe place—we'll just pick up the conversation tomorrow.’ And I think we actually ended up hiring that candidate.”
