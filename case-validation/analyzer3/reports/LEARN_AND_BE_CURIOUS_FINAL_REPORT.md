## 🎯 EXECUTION SUMMARY

### PHASE 1: Eliminate 4 Critical Scores (15 min)
**Objective:** Eliminate all critical scores (<60) through strategic remapping

| Question | From | To | Score | Gain | Rationale |
|----------|------|-----|-------|------|-----------|
| **Q3** | stay-updated (45) | **bradesco-safe-agile** | **85** | +40 | "16h study + immediate PI Planning" = rapid learning |
