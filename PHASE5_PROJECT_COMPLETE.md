## Scoring Strategy

### Phase-Specific Ranges
- **Phase 1-3**: 85-98 (comprehensive evidence, TOP CASES focus)
- **Phase 4**: 88-92 (sufficient tier, medium priority LPs)
- **Phase 5**: 85-92 (good/sufficient tier, low priority + unmapped)

### Rationale
- Higher scores (92+) for unmapped cases with exceptional evidence
- Mid-range scores (85-90) for insufficient → well-mapped transitions
- Consistent scoring across similar evidence strength

---

## Files Modified

### Primary Files
- `src/data/questionsToCasesMapping.js` (5 LP sections updated)
  - are_right_a_lot: +2 mappings
  - customer_obsession: +1 mapping
  - hire_and_develop_the_best: +1 mapping
  - think_big: +1 mapping
  - insist_on_highest_standards: +6 mappings

### Documentation
- `case-validation/reports/audit-final.json` (auto-generated)
- `PHASE5_PROJECT_COMPLETE.md` (this file)
