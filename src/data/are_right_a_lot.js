Segunda etapa: personally escrevi 23 SQL queries customizadas no Firebase Analytics, cruzando event data com transaction data durante 6 months retrospective analysis. Descobri que 85% dos daily logins e 90% das transações críticas (PIX, pagamentos, transfers) vinham do mobile. Das transações mobile, 90% eram PIX e payment processing - core da nossa payment operations engine. Terceira etapa crucial: para deliberately challenge my emerging mobile-first hypothesis, busquei actively data que a refutasse. Analyzed LTV por platform, onde descobri que embora average ticket per transaction fosse 34% maior no desktop, retention rate 30% superior no mobile tornava mobile LTV significatively mais valuable (R$ 2.340 vs R$ 1.890).
