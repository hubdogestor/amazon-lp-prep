        a: "Minha primeira ação foi mergulhar diretamente na voz do cliente. EU pessoalmente conduzi 47 entrevistas em profundidade com beneficiários (mix de detratores, neutros e promotores) durante 6 semanas para entender pain points reais. Descobri que 73% das frustrações vinham de 3 problemas específicos: processo de autorização lento (média 4.8 dias), dificuldade para encontrar credenciados disponíveis, e comunicação fragmentada entre canais. Identifiquei também uma necessidade não expressa de um produto premium para C-levels de empresas clientes - eles queriam status diferenciado e atendimento concierge, mas nossa oferta era commoditizada. Para transformar insights em ação, desenhei e facilitei pessoalmente workshops com cada uma das 5 diretorias onde apresentei o framework de OKRs e facilitei a co-criação dos Key Results centrados no cliente. Por exemplo, Diretoria Médica: 'Reduzir tempo de autorização de 4.8 para 2.0 dias' vs. output tradicional 'Processar X autorizações/mês'. Construí uma matriz RICE pontuando cada uma das 12 iniciativas identificadas: a simplificação do login com biometria teve score de 420 pontos (Reach: 100k usuários x Impact: 3 x Confidence: 70% / Effort: 0.5 meses), superando as demais iniciativas. Liderei uma squad de inovação ágil focada nos pain points críticos identificados pelos clientes para lançar 4 novos produtos em 12 meses: 1) 'Autorização Express' via app (autorização em <2h para 80% dos casos), 2) 'Encontrar Médico' com disponibilidade real-time, 3) 'Produto Pet Saúde' co-criado com grupo beta de 50 clientes, 4) 'App de Bem-estar' (este falhou - baixa adoção porque não endereçou uma dor real dos clientes). EU criei métricas de customer obsession em todos os business cases: em vez de apenas ROI financeiro, incluí 'impact score no cliente' e 'voice of customer validation score' como critérios obrigatórios para aprovação de qualquer iniciativa.",

Mais importante: geramos US$ 70.4 milhões de impacto direto no EBITDA (22% de aumento sobre base de US$ 320M) através de: retenção melhorada (US$ 28M), cross-sell para produto premium (US$ 19M), redução de custo de aquisição (US$ 12M), e operational efficiency (US$ 11.4M). O 'Produto Pet Saúde' se tornou nossa maior fonte de NPS promoters (87% dos usuários), validando que innovation centrada no cliente gera resultados business tangíveis. Embora ainda houvesse espaço para melhorar em relação a benchmarks de healthtechs (Alice: NPS 71), estabelecemos a Unimed como a operadora tradicional com maior crescimento em customer satisfaction no setor.",

O maior insight foi que clientes de saúde valorizam confiança e transparência acima de tecnologia fancy - por isso nosso produto premium focou em human touch premium, não apenas tech. Customer obsession verdadeira significa medir sucesso pela lente do cliente primeiro, business results segundo - mas ironicamente isso gera os melhores business results no longo prazo."

I personally conducted 47 in-depth interviews with beneficiaries (mix of detractors, neutrals, and promoters) during 6 weeks to understand real pain points. I discovered that 73% of frustrations came from 3 specific problems: slow authorization process (average 4.8 days), difficulty finding available credentialed providers, and fragmented communication between channels. I also identified an unexpressed need for a premium product for client companies' C-levels - they wanted differentiated status and concierge service, but our offering was commoditized. To transform insights into action, I designed and personally facilitated workshops with each of the 5 directorates where I presented the OKR framework and facilitated co-creation of customer-centered Key Results. For example, Medical Directorate: 'Reduce authorization time from 4.8 to 2.0 days' vs. traditional output 'Process X authorizations/month.' I built a RICE matrix scoring each of the 12 identified initiatives: biometric login simplification scored 420 points (Reach: 100k users x Impact: 3 x Confidence: 70% / Effort: 0.5 months), surpassing other initiatives. I led an agile innovation squad focused on critical pain points identified by customers to launch 4 new products in 12 months: 1) 'Express Authorization' via app (authorization in <2h for 80% of cases), 2) 'Find Doctor' with real-time availability, 3) 'Pet Health Product' co-created with beta group of 50 clients, 4) 'Wellness App' (this failed - low adoption because it didn't address a real customer pain). I created customer obsession metrics in all business cases: instead of just financial ROI, I included 'customer impact score' and 'voice of customer validation score' as mandatory criteria for approving any initiative.",

More importantly: we generated US$ 70.4 million direct EBITDA impact (22% increase over US$ 320M base) through: improved retention (US$ 28M), cross-sell to premium product (US$ 19M), acquisition cost reduction (US$ 12M), and operational efficiency (US$ 11.4M). The 'Pet Health Product' became our biggest source of NPS promoters (87% of users), validating that customer-centered innovation generates tangible business results. Although there was still room to improve relative to healthtech benchmarks (Alice: NPS 71), we established Unimed as the traditional operator with highest customer satisfaction growth in the sector.",

Em vez de perguntar 'quais features vocês querem?', EU perguntei 'descrevam a experiência de checkout mágica que seus clientes sonham'. Isso revelou insights poderosos: consumidores abandonavam não por desconfiança no pagamento, mas por friction em validações desnecessárias. O maior insight foi que lojistas queriam validação completa de endereço para evitar chargebacks, mas consumidores queriam velocidade. EU defendi e priorizei uma solução mais simples de auto-completar endereços focada 100% na velocidade para o consumidor, com validação de risco acontecendo em background sem afetar o flow. Para validar a solution antes de full development, criei um pilot com 3 parceiros estratégicos (e-commerces de moda, eletrônicos, e marketplace) representando different customer behaviors. EU pessoalmente acompanhei sessões de teste com consumidores reais desses partners, observando suas reações e friction points em tempo real. A customer obsession não parou no launch - implementei feedback loops permanentes com NPS pós-transação e heatmaps do checkout flow para continuous improvement baseado em comportamento real do consumer.",

O success do pilot se tornou nosso principal diferencial competitivo, nos ajudando a conquistar 15 novas grandes contas de e-commerce no ano seguinte, including major retailers que haviam anteriormente rejected nosso gateway por friction concerns.

          a: "O biggest obstacle foi que engineering teams measured success by technical metrics (uptime, response time, error rates) rather than customer metrics (satisfaction, task completion, effort). Engineers were proud of robust infrastructure mas didn't see connection to customer experience. EU addressed isso by creating shared dashboards que showed direct correlation between technical performance e customer satisfaction. When engineers saw que their optimization work directly improved customer happiness, mindset shifted from 'technically correct' to 'customer optimal'."
